<p id="examp">Hi, you probably noticed the new 'page option', huh?</p>
<p id="examp">Well, it's not done yet but will be soon. I realized that fitting every interview into one page might make things feel too cluttered. So therefore, i'll separate interview by pages. ~10 interview/page is what i'm thinking would be ideal.</p>
<p id="examp"><br>Until then, play around with this square I guess. (Mouse over it)</p>
